# Bouncing Balls for Yieldify Tech Test

### Features/Requirements:

- [x] When the user clicks on the page, a 'ball' (circle) is fired from the clicked position.
- [x] The ball is fired at a random speed and angle.
- [x] The user can click multiple times for multiple balls to appear and bounce at the same time.

### Guidelines:

- Use any combination of web technologies to complete the task.
- Submit in a format that is easy for us to run / inspect from the browser.
- Your code should be written as if it were going to be deployed today i.e. using standard technologies commonly supported by most current browsers.
- You will be evaluated both on your implementation choices and the quality of your codeÍ¾ so please ensure code is well structured, extensible, testable, readable, commented etc.
- All code related to the physics of the ball should be authored by the applicant: do not use game engines, physics engines or other third party libraries to animate the balls.
- Any 3rd party code (at all) should be clearly attributed.
